## USENET \(Newsgroup\) Automated Posting


</div>

### Description

This is a fully functional, although probably not entirely bug free application. This application is designed to allow you to post messages to numerous newsgroups automatically. It can handle multiple servers. Allows you to save groups of newsgroups to post to. Automatically UUEncodes attachments. Specify the number of groups to cross post to at a time, etc.

I spent about 4 days learning the NNTP specs and programming this program, I certainly hope that you find some educational value in it. If you like it let me know, send me an e-mail and vote for me if you want. If you need any help with any part of it, don't hesitate to ask.
